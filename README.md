Thease are fully 3D printeable digital Night vision googles. now im going to start by breaking expectations, this are not L3 Harris Gen 3 Image intensifier tubes, if you are expecting that kind of preformance out of a $600 DIGITAL nvg then I would recomend that you 
save your money till someone else figures out how to acomplish that, this are great if you want to get into NV or if you want a seccond unit that you can let your friends use, or if you want to experience dual tube nods without burning $10000.

now if you somehow read all of this and still want to build em, here is what you will need

Now the assembly steps are provided with the 3D files for the housing and avilible in the discord server Ive made specificly for this project. trough that discord server ill post 3D models updates for those of you that decide to purchase the files, and in the DS server 
you can find every resource I created so you can assembly the unit succesfully.
The total cost of the NVG ranges from 500€ to 600€, and $600 to $670 in fredoom units, but the total cost of the unit can depend as aliexpres changes prices troughout the year.
All of the parts listed above can be easily found on aliexpress and the price range i just talked about includes all the hardware needed for the build, 3D files, and the 3D printed parts with PCBway with a 100% infil if you own your own printer then the hole unit goes
for 480€ to 580€ and $530 to $600

now assembling the unit is pretty straight forward and iv meade everything so you wont need screws but just as a precaution I added 2 M3 screws to lock the tubes to the bridge
